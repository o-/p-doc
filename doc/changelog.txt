* playing around with various method invocation methods:
  - using the directly stack-pointer to access locals!
  - (ab)using the frame-pointer? rather pass args as c-args!
    therefore not having to worry about how gcc does optimize the code...
* minimizing ammount of registers that are saved and restored -> 
  therefore don't use variables before and after method calls inside method_context
* map method_function to message sends (prototype 1)
* organize opcodes as goto labels inside method_context function
* starting to use cmockery
* getting dictionaries to run. implementing initial grow.
